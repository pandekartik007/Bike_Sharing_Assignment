## General Information
The primary objective of this project is to identify the key variables that significantly influence the demand for shared bikes in the American market, particularly post-lockdown. By building a multivariate linear regression model using the provided dataset, the goal is to understand how these variables affect bike demand, assess the effectiveness of these predictors in explaining demand patterns, and develop adaptive business strategies for BoomBikes to accelerate revenue growth once the pandemic subsides. This model will help BoomBikes make informed decisions to better cater to consumer needs and sustain their business in a post-Covid world.
